Gameplay Test Requirement
Our game has 3 game mechanics that are functional though need more tweaking to be perfect. These mechanics are crouching using the LeftShift button which will be used to lower detection from enemies, and also lowers the player's speed by half. Second mechanic is the sheild mechanic which will deflect all projectiles, you can spawn this sheild using the "E" button. Last mechanic is the portal the mechanic where you can spawn an entrance portal using the "LeftMouse Button" on a blue tile to spwan a blue portal and use the "RightMouse Button" on the orange tile which will spawn an orange portal. When you spawn both portals, if you enter the blue portal you will come out of the organe portal. You use the mouse to move the camera around and WASD to move around.

Art Test Requirement
We have 10 unique models which you will be able to see if you look left from where you spawn in the scene you will see a row of 10 models in a line. 5 of these models are textured completely.
