Game Play 

The goal of the game is to collect portal flames and avoid enemies after the player enters each of three different portals. 
Hell is nearly complete and just needs a few cosmetic modifications. The player can croutch to hide from snakes 
Purgatory is half finished. It includes physical assets for the intended puzzle but is missing cosmetic aspects such as the main rock texture and the particle effects. 
Heaven is nearly complete. The angel model is missing a texture and animation. The main deflect mechanic works. 

Escape with the portal fire to win 
dying is a loss


WASD are the movement keys 

Three main mechanicas have been implemented and are funtional in all levels

LeftShift used to croutch which the player will use to avoid enemys and attacks 
E allows player to deflect enemy attacks 
Left Mouse Click will spawn blue portal 
Right Mouse CLick will spawn orange portal 

Entering either portal will allow the player to exit from the opposite.
